support docs for EEC

In this repository are any documents which help the analysis or understanding of the EEC itself, the CPU and layout etc.
Stategy documents are separate really as they are related to the tune and response of the actual software design,
and as such sit in STRATEGY repository, or with the relevant EEC binary.

8061 and 8065 are based upon an 8096 (80196 etc) core, so the user manual is useful for the instruction set and operation details, but the fixed addresses and other aspects are not relevant.
Included is Tom Cloud's original explanation document - old but still useful for core information and understanding.
also a low level electronic spec sheet of the 8096, useful for background info.
